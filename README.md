# 💫 About Me:
⭐ I'm from Albany, OR, **USA**. I am dedicated to being an advocate for all humans and products that help make life better for us :)  
⭐ I am advancing my technical expertise by pursuing a **Master of Science in Information Technology**, building upon my foundational Bachelor's degree in Psychology.  Additionally, I hold a **Business Intelligence Certificate** and a TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) Certificate.  
⭐ I pivoted from **customer service**, **allied healthcare**, **education**, and **security** work and volunteer roles that supported my educational goals and my family while developing my soft skills. 

💡 This unique combination of education and experience allows me to bridge the gap between sophisticated data solutions and the human-centered business problems they are meant to solve.  

## ⚡ Skills:
**Data analysis, data visualization, story-telling, business analytics, problem-solving, communication, collaboration, adaptability, teaching, and leadership.**
