As a driven individual with a diverse background in education, security, healthcare, and even food service, I've honed my communication, problem-solving, and client interaction skills. Now, I'm eager to transition my expertise to a Business Intelligence Analyst role where I can leverage my data analysis abilities to drive informed decision-making.

Throughout my career, I've thrived in fast-paced environments, consistently exceeding expectations in customer service, administrative tasks, and issue resolution. This experience, coupled with my strong academic background, has equipped me with the analytical mindset and technical aptitude needed to excel in this field. I'm a quick learner, highly motivated, and possess a collaborative spirit. When I'm not exploring data, I enjoy crafting and video games.</p>
